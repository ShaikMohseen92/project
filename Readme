Steps:

1. Clone my project to IDE

2. Select TrialSignup.java file

3. Run as Java application



I attempted to create a mini project and develop test scripts around it, but I required more time to complete it. 
I faced elements returning null errors in the com.trailsignup.Locators and an issue with the Chrome driver not 
supporting my MAC version of Chrome. Unfortunately, due to the time constraints, I was unable to address these issues 
and could not achieve the reCAPTCHA.

Instead, I used Firefox to run my test scripts and tried creating scripts for the signup page. Had I had sufficient 
time to address the CAPTCHA problem, I would have been able to automate most of the functionalities outlined in the 
test case document.
